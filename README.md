This Prework Study Guide was created to have a reference to look back on for different topics I have learned and will be learning more about as this taught the basics and building blocks I will be using moving forward. I learned different topics such as  HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript while working on this project. It contains notes I saw helpful on these topics.
